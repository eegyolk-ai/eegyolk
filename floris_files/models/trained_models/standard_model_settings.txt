Hyperparameters settings:
    dimensions: (26, 501)
    learning rate: 1e-3 with factor 0.9 if validation loss doesn't improve.
    epochs: 100
    batch size: 8
    added noise: 1 microVolt
    trial averages: 30
    
The folder name contains:
    1. the dataset on which the model is trained (ddp/epod)
    2. the model architecture (encoder/resnet) 
    3. the label on which the model is trained (age/atrisk)
    3. the index of the model
    
The folder name contains certain variable values if they differ from the standard:
    1. number of 'channels'. Standard are the '26' channels that are in both the ddp as the epod dataset
    2. the 'sampling rate' of the data. Standard is the sampling rate '500Hz'. The sampling rate of ddp. The sampling rate of epod is 2048HZ.
    3. number of 'trials to average' to get the model input: an ERP signal. Standard is set to '30'.
    4. introduced noise to prevent overfitting (standard is 1e-6 V standard-deviation)
