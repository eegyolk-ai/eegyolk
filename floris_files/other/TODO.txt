Ask Karin for more metadata ePOD

DDP:
All the DDP files have differently set-up events. 
Some files have 62 channels, others 30.
Loading with 'mne.io.read_raw_cnt' produces two RuntimeWarnings (can be ignored)


Only use DDP for age prediction/transfer learning?

EPOD:
EXG1 and EXG2 channels are very noisy. Should we use mastoid channels?

Processing:
Should we standardise EEG data?


1. Process DDP files (processing pipeline)
2. Train DDP on age with Transformer
Clean code!
Analyse DDP ERPs
3. Use same processing pipeline with ePod
4. See if correct ERPs can be produced with processed ePod
5. Train ePod on age for any correlation (age/sex/a-b/at-risk/dyslexic parents)
